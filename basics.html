  <p>
    Yu-Gi-Oh is a trading card game where players use a deck of cards to battle against each     other. The objective is to reduce the opponent's Life Points to zero. Each player starts with a set number of Life Points and a hand of cards.
  </p>

  <p>
Players take turns drawing cards and playing them onto the field. Cards can be monsters, spells, or traps, each with their own unique abilities and effects. Monsters can attack and defend, while spells and traps can be used to support or disrupt gameplay.
  </p>

  <p>
  To play a monster, a player must first tribute other monsters they control, or place it directly onto the field if it has a low level. Monsters have attack and defense points, and players can attack their opponent's monsters or directly attack their opponent's Life Points.
  </p>

  <p>
  Spells and traps are played face-down and can be activated at any time to support or disrupt gameplay. Spells can be used to strengthen monsters or weaken opponents, while traps can be used to counter attacks or activate other effects.
  </p>

  <p>
  The game also features special types of cards called Fusion, Synchro, Xyz, and Link monsters, which require specific combinations of other monsters to be played onto the field.
  </p>

  <p>
  The gameplay and strategies involved in Yu-Gi-Oh are complex and require a thorough understanding of the rules and card abilities. Players must carefully construct their decks and make strategic decisions throughout the game to outwit their opponents and emerge victorious.

  <h2>How The Show Breaks Its Own Rules</h2>
  <p>
    The original television show and the card game are drastically different in terms of rules and regulations. The show mostly just made up rules or cards that don't and never will exist in the actual card game. Other ways the show breaks its own rules is the summoning of monsters. You can only normal summon one monster per turn, which the show often has Yugi and others summoning multiple at a time. Also tributing, or sacrificing monsters basically just didn't exist at all in the show despite being a major part of the real game. The biggest issue with the show and game is how the show just makes up randomly abilities for cards that don't do anything close to what they're supposed to. This often led to over powered cards and moves that would never happen in a real game. If the show played by the actual game's rules, Yugi would have most likely lost every duel he had. Overall the show is still amazing, mostly for how silly and goofy it can be, and I would highly recommend you watch it.
