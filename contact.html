  <h1> My Favorite Character: Joey Wheeler</h1>
  
  <img src=/images/joey-PhotoRoom.png alt="Picture of Joey Wheeler">

  <p>
    Joey Wheeler is a fan-favorite character in the Yu-Gi-Oh anime series known for his goofy and lighthearted
    personality. Despite not being the most skilled player, Joey's determination and loyalty to his friends make him a
    beloved character among fans.
  </p>

  <p>
    Joey is portrayed as a fun-loving and sometimes clumsy character, often providing comic relief in tense situations.
    However, he is also a loyal and selfless friend, always willing to put himself in harm's way to protect those he
    cares about.
  </p>

  <p>
    Joey's "goofiness" is part of what makes him such a relatable and endearing character. He often struggles with the
    complexities of the game and makes mistakes, but he never gives up and always tries his best. This makes his
    victories all the more satisfying and his defeats all the more heartbreaking.
  </p>

  <p>
    Overall, Joey's humor and loyalty make him a standout character in the Yu-Gi-Oh series, and his relatable struggles
    and triumphs have endeared him to fans for years.
  </p>

  <p>
    I personally like Joey due to his voice and the way he acts throughout the show. He is the comedic relief who I
    found I was rooting for more than the main character Yugi. Overall I just enjoy his character because of how goofy
    his voice and actions are.
